## Teaching
* Taught software engineering techniques in weekly discussion sections for Stanfordâ€™s Programming Methodologies course
* Held 1-on-1 interactive grading sessions, gave students feedback, and provided input on curriculum

## Learning design (and a bit of coding)
* Worked closely with faculty to ensure accessibility of assignments and course materials for visually impaired students
* Built and documented Python API for TextGrid, an alternative framework for the image processing assignment for visually impaired CS106A students
* Wrote a tool called Photoshop Superlite which enables CS106A students to playfully apply their own image processing filters to parts of existing images, for use in future section problems
